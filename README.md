#  Breast Cancer Prediction (ML)


This project uses **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** to predict breast cancer diagnosis using the `sklearn` dataset.

Inspired by Andrew Ng’s ML Specialization, this project predicts breast cancer (Benign vs Malignant) using a Random Forest Classifier . The app, built with Scikit-learn and Streamlit, not only delivers predictions but also provides model evaluation tools like the Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve (AUC score), along with Feature Importance for explainability.

### Features
- Data preprocessing 
- Two models with evaluation
- Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, Feature Importance
- Streamlit app for quick demo

**Note for Users:**  
The additional plots like **Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Feature Importance** are included to help you understand how well the model performs and which tumor features impact predictions the most.  
Refer to the screenshots above in the `assets/` folder for a quick overview.
